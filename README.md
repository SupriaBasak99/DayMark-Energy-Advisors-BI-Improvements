# BI-Implementation for Energy Consulting Company
BI implementation recommendations for the Energy Consulting Company to get their BI model from Child Stage to Adult Stage by breaking the chasm. Included with this repo is a tactical dashboard which gives information about the projects queues for the managers, a Operational dashboard which changes daily to show the Load and Energy Prices throughout the USA, and a Forecasting Model to forecaste energy prices using gas prices for the New England region. The data is taken from ISO New England from where the company also fetches the data.
